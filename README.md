# bandits

Use bandits to optimize your websites. It provides a simple alternative to A/B tests using multiarmed bandits.

`bandits` uses the `stack` tool for reliable builds. Just invoke

```
$ stack build && stack exec bandits
```

to start a server. In the future you may need some database. This is in early development so do not expect it work yet.
